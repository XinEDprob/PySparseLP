@article{Mahapatra2011,
abstract = {Poor contrast in magnetic resonance images makes cardiac left ventricle (LV) segmentation a very challenging task. We propose a novel graph cut framework using shape priors for segmentation of the LV from dynamic cardiac perfusion images. The shape prior information is obtained from a single image clearly showing the LV. The shape penalty is assigned based on the orientation angles between a pixel and all edge points of the prior shape. We observe that the orientation angles have distinctly different distributions for points inside and outside the LV. To account for shape change due to deformations, pixels near the boundary of the prior shape are allowed to change their labels by appropriate formulation of the penalty and smoothness terms. Experimental results on real patient datasets show our method's superior performance compared to two similar methods.},

@article{Tappen2007,
abstract = {Markov random field, or MRF, models are a powerful tool for modeling images. While much progress has been made in algorithms for inference in MRFs, learning the parameters of an MRF is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we show how variational optimization can be used to learn the parameters of an MRF. This method for learning, which we refer to as variational mode learning, finds the MRF parameters by minimizing a loss function that penalizes the difference between ground-truth images and an approximate, variational solution to the MRF. In particular, we focus on learning parameters for the field of experts model of Roth and Black. In addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of this method, we show that a model based on derivative filters performs quite similarly to the field of experts model. This suggests that the field of experts model, which is difficult to interpret, can be understood as imposing piecewise continuity on the image.},

abstract = {We propose a novel way to induce a random field from an energy function on discrete labels. It amounts to locally injecting noise to the energy potentials, followed by finding the global minimum of the perturbed energy function. The resulting Perturb-and-MAP random fields harness the power of modern discrete energy minimization algorithms, effectively transforming them into efficient random sampling algorithms, thus extending their scope beyond the usual deterministic setting. In this fashion we can enjoy the benefits of a sound probabilistic framework, such as the ability to represent the solution uncertainty or learn model parameters from training data, while completely bypassing costly Markov-chain Monte-Carlo procedures typically associated with discrete label Gibbs Markov random fields (MRFs). We study some interesting theoretical properties of the proposed model in juxtaposition to those of Gibbs MRFs and address the issue of principled design of the perturbation process. We present experimental results in image segmentation and scene labeling that illustrate the new qualitative aspects and the potential of the proposed model for practical computer vision applications.},

@article{Hosni2013a,
abstract = {Many computer vision tasks can be formulated as labeling problems. The desired solution is often a spatially smooth labeling where label transitions are aligned with color edges of the input image. We show that such solutions can be efficiently achieved by smoothing the label costs with a very fast edge-preserving filter. In this paper, we propose a generic and simple framework comprising three steps: 1) constructing a cost volume, 2) fast cost volume filtering, and 3) Winner-Takes-All label selection. Our main contribution is to show that with such a simple framework state-of-the-art results can be achieved for several computer vision applications. In particular, we achieve 1) disparity maps in real time whose quality exceeds those of all other fast (local) approaches on the Middlebury stereo benchmark, and 2) optical flow fields which contain very fine structures as well as large displacements. To demonstrate robustness, the few parameters of our framework are set to nearly identical values for both applications. Also, competitive results for interactive image segmentation are presented. With this work, we hope to inspire other researchers to leverage this framework to other application areas.},

@article{Woodford2009,
abstract = {Second-order priors on the smoothness of 3D surfaces are a better model of typical scenes than first-order priors. However, stereo reconstruction using global inference algorithms, such as graph cuts, has not been able to incorporate second-order priors because the triple cliques needed to express them yield intractable (nonsubmodular) optimization problems. This paper shows that inference with triple cliques can be effectively performed. Our optimization strategy is a development of recent extensions to alpha -- expansion, based on the "QPBO" algorithm. The strategy is to repeatedly merge proposal depth maps using a novel extension of QPBO. Proposal depth maps can come from any source, for example, frontoparallel planes as in alpha-expansion, or indeed any existing stereo algorithm, with arbitrary parameter settings.},

@article{Figueiredo1997,
abstract = {Discontinuity-preserving Bayesian image restoration typically involves two Markov random fields: one representing the image intensities/gray levels to be recovered and another one signaling discontinuities/edges to be preserved. The usual strategy is to perform joint maximum a posterori (MAP) estimation of the image and its edges, which requires the specification of priors for both fields. Instead of taking an edge prior, we interpret discontinuities (in fact their locations) as deterministic unknown parameters of the compound Gauss-Markov random field (CGMRF), which is assumed to model the intensities. This strategy should allow inferring the discontinuity locations directly from the image with no further assumptions. However, an additional problem emerges: the number of parameters (edges) is unknown. To deal with it, we invoke the minimum description length (MDL) principle; according to MDL, the best edge configuration is the one that allows the shortest description of the image and its edges. Taking the other model parameters (noise and CGMRF variances) also as unknown, we propose a new unsupervised discontinuity-preserving image restoration criterion. Implementation is carried out by a continuation-type iterative algorithm which provides estimates of the number of discontinuities, their locations, the noise variance, the original image variance, and the original image itself (restored image). Experimental results with real and synthetic images are reported.},

abstract = {In this work, we introduce a novel implicit representation of shape which is based on assigning to each pixel a probability that this pixel is inside the shape. This probabilistic representation of shape resolves two important drawbacks of alternative implicit shape representations such as the level set method: Firstly, the space of shapes is convex in the sense that arbitrary convex combinations of a set of shapes again correspond to a valid shape. Secondly, we prove that the introduction of shape priors into variational image segmentation leads to functionals which are convex with respect to shape deformations. For a large class of commonly considered (spatially continuous) functionals, we prove that - under mild regularity assumptions - segmentation and tracking with statistical shape priors can be performed in a globally optimal manner. In experiments on tracking a walking person through a cluttered scene we demonstrate the advantage of global versus local optimality.},

abstract = {This paper presents MeshGit, a practical algorithm for diffing and merging polygonal meshes. Inspired by version control for text editing, we introduce the mesh edit distance as a measure of the dissimilarity between meshes. This distance is defined as the min- imum cost of matching the vertices and faces of one mesh to those of another. We propose an iterative greedy algorithm to approxi- mate the mesh edit distance, which scales well with model com- plexity, providing a practical solution to our problem. We translate the mesh correspondence into a set of mesh editing operations that transforms the first mesh into the second. The editing operations can be displayed directly to provide a meaningful visual difference between meshes. For merging, we compute the difference between two versions and their common ancestor, as sets of editing opera- tions. We robustly detect conflicting operations, automatically ap- ply non-conflicting edits, and allowthe user to choose howto merge the conflicting edits. We evaluate MeshGit by diffing and merging a variety of meshes and find it to work well for all.},

abstract = {Unsupervised image segmentation is an important component in many image understanding algorithms and practical vision systems. However, evaluation of segmentation algorithms thus far has been largely subjective, leaving a system designer to judge the effectiveness of a technique based only on intuition and results in the form of a few example segmented images. This is largely due to image segmentation being an ill-defined problem-there is no unique ground-truth segmentation of an image against which the output of an algorithm may be compared. This paper demonstrates how a recently proposed measure of similarity, the Normalized Probabilistic Rand (NPR) index, can be used to perform a quantitative comparison between image segmentation algorithms using a hand-labeled set of ground-truth segmentations. We show that the measure allows principled comparisons between segmentations created by different algorithms, as well as segmentations on different images. We outline a procedure for algorithm evaluation through an example evaluation of some familiar algorithms-the mean-shift-based algorithm, an efficient graph-based segmentation algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of both methods, and expectation maximization. Results are presented on the 300 images in the publicly available Berkeley Segmentation Data Set.},

@article{Bastert2010,
abstract = {A very important ingredient for solving hard general integer programs are heuristics that try to quickly find good feasible solutions. One of these heuristics is Wedelin's algorithm, which works for the limited class of 0-1 integer programs. A big advantage of Wedelin's approach is that it does not depend on a solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation as many other heuristics do. This makes it extremely fast in practice and makes it easy to use the parallelism of the upcoming multicore CPUs, as in an integer programming (IP) solver it could be applied in parallel to the traditional branch-and-bound algorithm. In this paper, we present several extensions and generalizations to Wedelin's algorithm (most can be handled in an implicit manner without much performance cost) and investigate different ways of improving it. We give all necessary details and parameters. We strive for an algorithm that is faster than other heuristics but achieves comparable solution quality. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on a large set of more than 100 instances from different sources. The results indicate that our heuristic often finds solutions comparable to or even better than those found using current state-of-the-art heuristics while typically needing only a fraction of their running time. Additionally, we report positive findings on the application of the heuristic on feasibility instances from discrete tomography. Our algorithm always finds the IP optimum in less time than the simplex/barrier algorithms and often in less time than it takes the volume algorithm to find just the LP optimum.},
